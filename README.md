# 🛢️ Commodity Data Platform

A simulated data engineering platform for commodity trading analytics, inspired by a real-world Glencore use case. This project demonstrates end-to-end ingestion, transformation, validation, and API delivery of commodity market data using modern tools like Airflow, Spark, FastAPI, and Great Expectations.

---

## 📊 Use Case

Designed to support trading analysts by delivering clean, transformed, and validated data from external sources (EIA API, web news scraping). The project includes:

- **Batch Ingestion** from APIs and websites
- **Spark-based Transformation** and optimization
- **Automated Data Validation** using Great Expectations
- **API Layer** with FastAPI
- **Workflow Orchestration** with Apache Airflow
- **CI/CD** using GitHub Actions
- **Containerized Setup** with Docker Compose
